# Generative Design Using p5.js
Following generative design practices and book by Hartmut Bohnacker

These are the two chapters we focused on and all of the pieces created throughout the year are designated to the correct section.
## Chapters covered
1. [Colour](P1_COLOUR/)
2. [Shape & Type](P1_SHAPE/)



## Shape & Colour

These are the foundations and basics of generative design. This is a complete summary of my work that I produced in class and for continuous assessments throughout the year. The p5.js library was used to create these pieces along with in-class tutorials from my lecturer and the book Generative design, written by Hartmut Bohnacker, BenediktbGrob, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni.
